Finding all the sums of two numbers in the `preamble` length subarray

Create a dictionary, in which keys are the sums of two numbers and the value
is a tuple containing the indices of the two numbers that produced this sum.

Although there are two nested for loops, it turns out as O(preamble * n),
which is essentially O(n).

# Finding the sum of a subarray

Use two pointers, that point to the first and last value (or in this case
slicepoint) of the subarray. On each turn, the left pointer moves one step
to the right and right pointer moves to the right as long as the resulting
subarray sum is at most our target value. If the sum is our target value
then we have found the solution.
